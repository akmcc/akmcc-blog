<h3> About A K McCrate </h3>
<p>I'm Ashton. I'm a human being (family: Hominidae, genus: Homo, species: sapien). I am on a never-ending mission to myelinate my neurons. I am currently studying at Hacker School to advance my understanding of various computer technologies. I primarily work with Ruby, but am spending some time with JS, CS theory, and what ever else proves to be captivating.</p>
<p>My interests include logic, sense of place, flow, and pushing the boundary. My goal is to create instances that incorporate elements of each.</p>
